# [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)


This is my new project to get some experience in coding. Besides [Codewars](https://https://www.codewars.com/) , I need more practice. The idea is to do as many projects as possible. Even if I just write it down, instead of thinking about the solution.

**It is all about practice.**

Best regards

PS: Even this Markdown ist practice, because I know work with a [Markdown Editor](https://https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17254-markdown-editor) for [Pycharm](https://https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/pycharm/) ðŸ˜„
