# Automate-the-Boring-Stuff-with-Python

These are my solutions and exercies for the [webiste](https://https://automatetheboringstuff.com). I tried to do not everythink like the book said.

Sometimes I tried to improve or change a few things, ust for the example of trying. Something like the example of **The Collatz Sequence** in [Chapter 3](https://https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter3/).

Best regards
